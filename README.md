# dotfiles

My own implementation / fork of [Jeff Geerling's dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles) that I use to configure my own macOS or Linux systems.

The idea of my configuration files is that they are designed to be "relatively simple" & minimal. However, at the time time offer me a number of productivity
enhancements that I have found useful over the years.

## ðŸ”§ Configure

This repository is primarily designed to be used with my [`nurodev/config`](https://github.com/nurodev/config) repository that helps set up & configure a brand new macOS or Linux system.
